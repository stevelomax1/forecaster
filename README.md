Forecaster (Weather Dashboard)

This site was designed to be a weather forecast application that allows a user to search a city to get the current and 5 day weather forecast.

This weather dashboard will retrieve data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. It will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I used the API from open weather map to take in data. 

The weather dashboard will be a helpful tool for users looking to get the weather in various cities which will help plan accordingly.
